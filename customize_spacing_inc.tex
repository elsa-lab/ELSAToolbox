% \setlength{\medskipamount}{6.0pt plus 2.0pt minus 2.0pt}      % Vertical spacing of `\medskip`
% \setlength{\bigskipamount}{12.0pt plus 4.0pt minus 4.0pt}     % Vertical spacing of `\largeskip`

% \setlength{\textfloatsep}{1ex}    % Vertical spacing between last float and first text line
% \setlength{\dblfloatsep}{2ex}     % Vertical spacing between two floats (in two-column mode)
% \setlength{\dbltextfloatsep}{1ex} % Vertical spacing between last float and first text line (in two-column mode)

% ## Customize caption
%
% 1. Change font sizes
