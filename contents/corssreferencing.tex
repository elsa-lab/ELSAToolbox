\chapter{Cross Referencing}
\label{content:crossreferencing}

The \elsatoolbox{} package allows cross-referencing across two independent documents, \texttt{main.tex} and \texttt{supp.tex}. In other words, users can have a reference in \texttt{main.tex} to something labelled in \texttt{supp.tex}, without including \texttt{supp.tex} in \texttt{main.tex}. For example, \verb|\zref{supp:fig:example}| can easily reference Fig.~\zref{supp:fig:example} of \texttt{supp.tex}. There are two steps required to enable cross-referencing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a new file named \texttt{latexmkrc} and add the following code to it.
    \item Clear cached files and recompile.
\end{enumerate}
